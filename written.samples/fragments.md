This is an example where we have multiple fragments of Written Word here and there.

    local a = 10;
    local b = "Hello, my love!";

Another example goes here:

    local c = b .. " I am dreaming of you."

None of it connects to TextNet universe, yet.

```
function factorial(n) 
    if n == 0 then
        return 1
    end
    return n*factorial(n-1)
end
```

Now the function is defined, and we can run it.

    local N = factorial(10)

Fine?
