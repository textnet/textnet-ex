NEXT ITERATION(s)
- Written Word and events
- proper messaging
- refactoring

# Multiplayer and hosted universes
+ create two persistences
+ store 'persistenceId' next to id
+ `mutate` across network
> `renderer` across network
- `observer` across network
- proper messaging
- handle offline
- create three persistences, simulate lost reference
- move items between worlds

# Refactoring Refactored
- massive load across network -> subscribe on changes
- merge remote/network in one module


# SMALL THINGS TO PLAY WITH WHEN NOT ENOUGH CONCENTRATION
- another session of documentation
- even more refactor positions, coords, and vector stuff
- embed lua highlighting into markdown

# MAKE IT PRETTY!
- Apple Developer certificate
- animate entering the artifact
- animate leaving the artifact
- animate holding the artifact
- background & text colour overrides
- beautiful sprites
- good naming

# 4. Multiplayer

- [ ] Messaging library
- [ ] Address space
- [ ] Simultaneous multiplayer

# 5. Spoken word and gods
- [ ] Artifact libraries
- ... (plan further)

# 6. Full support for events
- Events
    + introduce roles
    + on: timer
    - on: move 
    - on: push/push-target (both actors)
    - on: pickup/pickup-target
    - on: putdown/putdown-target
    - on: enter/leave for world
    - on: enter/leave for artifact
    - on: stop (=closures in spatial commands)
- Redocument Written Word   
- WW: `move_by{ distance=10, angle=45 }`
- WW: travel in chairs <- learn how to put code into chairs, make bouncing chair
- WW: supporting enter/leave events (complex)

0. TIMER:   event happens all <objects>.
1. MOVE:    <object> is being moved (by another code, for example) in the <world>
2. PUSH:    <subject> pushes <object> in the <world>
3. PICKUP:  <subject> picks <object> up in the <world>
4. PUTDOWN: <subject> puts <object> down in the <world>
5. ENTER:   <object> is being entered into the <world> (e.g. by player or by another code)
6. LEAVE:   <object> is removed from the <world>

Which events happen when?
Events only happen if an observer is nearby.
Observer acts as <object>, <subject> or <world>
We have to supply `role` with each event.
Then here are options:
    
    on{ event="push", handler=custom_push } -- default role is <object> always
    on{ event="push", role="object", handler=custom_push }
    function custom_push(artifact, role, direction)
        -- body
    end
