# Textnet Electron Excalibur

This is an Excalibur+Electron prototype of the TXTNET.

## Debug cycle
    npm install
    ./start.sh

## Make installation package
    yarn dist

# BASIC CONTROLS
+ Movement: UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT
+ Artifacts:
    + Enter:  CTRL  + (move)
    + Leave:  ESC 
    + Push:   SHIFT + (move)
    + Pickup: ALT   + (move)
+ Written Word:
    + Enter: CTRL+ENTER 
    + Leave: CTRL+ENTER / ESC
- Spoken Word:
    - Say: ENTER
- Self:
    - Enter yourself: CTRL + ESCAPE



# Messaging Across Network
+ everyone sits in one channel and gets a socket per each other node.
+ `register` = join swarm
+ `conn` = found another peer
    - create RP and register it
+ `onMessage` get into cycle of sendMessageLocal
+ `sendMessage` find RP (or P) and write message
+ testing connection
+ BUG: load undefined is broken
+ BUG: race condition when connecting to swarm
+ reduce console.log
- shortcut local (for testing)
- BUG: teleport, TypeError: Cannot read property 'x' of undefined
- BUG: TypeError: Cannot read property 'split' of null
------------------------------------------------------------------------

- offline
    - send event = silent;
    - load
        - if the persistence is registered?
            - send...
                - return result.
                - ...timeout?
                    - deregister;
        - if not registered?
            - return `null`
                - learn to work with nulls everywhere;
                - ignore when loading artifacts for the world;
                - ignore on all mutates;
    - end.











------------------------------------------------------------

# Multiplayer and hosted universes
+ create two persistences
+ store 'persistenceId' next to id
+ `mutate` across network
+ `renderer` across network
+ `observer` across network
- proper messaging across network
- handle offline
- move items between three worlds


# Reasonable Refactoring
- merge remote/network in one module
- reduce duplication in RemoteEvent, echo, registry, mutate local/remote
- rewrite command system for observer, so move commands are chained with artifacts they move, not with the observer itself.
    - also rewrite object/subject for start/stop moving

# SMALL THINGS TO PLAY WITH WHEN NOT ENOUGH CONCENTRATION
- another session of documentation
- even more refactor positions, coords, and vector stuff
- lua highlighting within markdown
- when sending `move` event with `delta`, direction is broken
- WW: `move_by{ distance=10, angle=45 }`


# MAKE IT PRETTY!
- Apple Developer certificate
- animate entering the artifact
- animate leaving the artifact
- animate holding the artifact
- background & text colour overrides
- beautiful sprites
- good naming

# Big Things I Don't Want To Do
- massive load across network -> subscribe on changes

# 4. Multiplayer

+ Address space
+ Visiting other spaces
- Messaging library
- Expose world address
+ Portals to travel between words

# 5. Full support for events
+ Events
    + introduce roles
    + on: timer
    + on: move 
    + on: push/push-target (both actors)
    + on: pickup/pickup-target
    + on: putdown/putdown-target
    + on: enter/leave for world
    + on: enter/leave for artifact
    + on: stop (=closures in spatial commands)
+ WW: travel in chairs <- learn how to put code into chairs, make bouncing chair
+ WW: supporting enter/leave events
- Redocument Written Word and make a separate technical chapter on events
- refactor spatial chains
    - support halt
    - support proper object/subject


0. TIMER:   event happens all <objects>.
1. MOVE:    <object> is being moved (by another code, for example) in the <world>
2. PUSH:    <subject> pushes <object> in the <world>
3. PICKUP:  <subject> picks <object> up in the <world>
4. PUTDOWN: <subject> puts <object> down in the <world>
5. ENTER:   <object> is being entered into the <world> (e.g. by player or by another code)
6. LEAVE:   <object> is removed from the <world>

Which events happen when?
Events only happen if an observer is nearby.
Observer acts as <object>, <subject> or <world>
We have to supply `role` with each event.
Then here are options:
    
    on{ event="push", handler=custom_push } -- default role is <object> always
    on{ event="push", role="object", handler=custom_push }
    function custom_push(artifact, role, direction)
        -- body
    end


# Add New Event Checklist
- create RemoteEvent structures
- create `mutate` entry point
- implement `local` mutations
- implement `remote` proxies
- add to `registry`
- add to `echo`
- extend `supportedEvents` in Written Word

# How to write Written World commands
- `written/library.ts`
    - extend supported functions
- `written/library/...`
    - add file with command
    - data validation, local checks to save from roundabouts
    - prepare data structures required to call `mutate` if needed

# How to write new mutations
- `mutate` 
    - call other mutate commands
    - make necessary calculations or preparations
    - call `mutate/local` for worlds and artifacts that require data updates
- `mutate/local`
    - use template to call `mutate/remote`
    - save data to local persistence
- `mutate: remote`
    - add wrapper that calls
- `remote/event_structures`
    - create event structure that reflects `mutate` command
- render: mostly don't needed
