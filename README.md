    - Enter yourself: CTRL + ESCAPE

# BUGS BUGS BUGS BUGS
+ staggering walking. WHY?
    + only adjust player after t=0.5 sec
+ BUG: walking is not working remotely
+ BUG: disconnect is broken

# CURRENT ITERATION
+ Events support (with subscription)
    + timer
    + move
    + pickup
    + enter/leave
+ new events: push, start/stop moving
    + create RemoteEvent structures
    + push
    + start moving
    + stop moving
    + use start/stop in renderer
        + send by renderer
        + converted to mutate
        + replace old start/stop
    + observer should generate start/stop
+ make one chair run in circles
+ figure out how `pickup` event will still function = call before removing the object
+ `move_start` and `move_stop`: add object/subject to data


# NEXT ITERATION(s)
- proper messaging across network
- small refactoring

# Multiplayer and hosted universes
+ create two persistences
+ store 'persistenceId' next to id
+ `mutate` across network
+ `renderer` across network
+ `observer` across network
- proper messaging
- handle offline
- create three persistences, simulate lost reference
- move items between worlds

# Refactoring Refactored
- massive load across network -> subscribe on changes
- merge remote/network in one module
- reduce duplication in RemoteEvent, echo, registry, mutate local/remote
- rewrite command system for observer, so move commands are chained with artifacts they move, not with the observer itself.
    - also rewrite object/subject for start/stop moving


# SMALL THINGS TO PLAY WITH WHEN NOT ENOUGH CONCENTRATION
- another session of documentation
- even more refactor positions, coords, and vector stuff
- embed lua highlighting into markdown
- when sending `move` event with `delta`, direction is broken

# MAKE IT PRETTY!
- Apple Developer certificate
- animate entering the artifact
- animate leaving the artifact
- animate holding the artifact
- background & text colour overrides
- beautiful sprites
- good naming

# 4. Multiplayer

+ Address space
+ Visiting other spaces
- Portals to travel between words
- Expose world address
- Messaging library

# 5. Full support for events
- Events
    + introduce roles
    + on: timer
    + on: move 
    + on: push/push-target (both actors)
    + on: pickup/pickup-target
    + on: putdown/putdown-target
    + on: enter/leave for world
    + on: enter/leave for artifact
    - on: stop (=closures in spatial commands)
- WW: `move_by{ distance=10, angle=45 }`
+ WW: travel in chairs <- learn how to put code into chairs, make bouncing chair
+ WW: supporting enter/leave events
- Redocument Written Word and make a separate technical chapter on events  

0. TIMER:   event happens all <objects>.
1. MOVE:    <object> is being moved (by another code, for example) in the <world>
2. PUSH:    <subject> pushes <object> in the <world>
3. PICKUP:  <subject> picks <object> up in the <world>
4. PUTDOWN: <subject> puts <object> down in the <world>
5. ENTER:   <object> is being entered into the <world> (e.g. by player or by another code)
6. LEAVE:   <object> is removed from the <world>

Which events happen when?
Events only happen if an observer is nearby.
Observer acts as <object>, <subject> or <world>
We have to supply `role` with each event.
Then here are options:
    
    on{ event="push", handler=custom_push } -- default role is <object> always
    on{ event="push", role="object", handler=custom_push }
    function custom_push(artifact, role, direction)
        -- body
    end


# DOCUMENTATION HOW TO ADD EVENTS
- create RemoteEvent structures
- create `mutate` entry point
- implement `local` mutations
- implement `remote` proxies
- add to `registry`
- add to `echo`
- extend `supportedEvents` in Written Word
